## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The project uses platform-specific folders due to historical branching differences:

```

> **Note:** At some point there were differences between the Android and iOS branches, and it took too long to synchronize and condition the functionalities depending on the platform. The iOS branch is slightly ahead in terms of code changes.
